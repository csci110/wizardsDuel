#Wizard's Duel

##How to set up your workspace
Your instructor will provide a link to a GitHub Classroom invitation for this assignment. When you click the link, Classroom creates a new copy of this repo at github.com, with your username added to the end of the repo name.

To work with your new repo in a c9 workspace, go to Repositories from your c9 dashboard and hit the Clone to edit button on the assignment repo.

From your C9 workspace, right-click setup.sh in the c9 file tree, and choose Run from the menu. The script will fetch the submodules' code and you will then have:

sgc, and a script, github-tools/sync.sh that will synchronize your c9 workspace and your GitHub repo. This is how you "turn in" work. You can run this script the same way you ran the setup script (right-click -> Run).

##How to complete the assignment
In your c9 workspace, you will implement the Stranger Hunt game by following the instructions found at https://csci110.github.io/2_WizardsDuel.html.

##Submitting your work
You should submit your progress to github.com each time that you work on this assignment. (Don't wait until you are finished to submit.)

To submit your latest work, use c9's file navigator (in the Workspace tab on the left) to find github-tools/sync.sh. Right-click the file and click Run.

You should see a Run tab in the console pane at the bottom of the screen. (If you do not, try pressing F6, or choosing Console from the View menu.) If it asks for your github.com password, click to activate the console, type the password, and press Enter. (No characters will appear as you type the password.) If all goes well, the Run tab should display the following message.

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
If you encounter any problems with the submit process, capture a screen shot that includes contents of the Run tab and email it to your instructor.
